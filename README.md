# my-spring-boot-app
This is a first project which I use to study about Spring-boot framework. 
The reference of this project is at http://codesanook.com/post/details/beginning-spring-boot-part-1-new-project/1.<br>
Thank you for a good tutorial :)


Also, this is a first project I use to learn what GitHub can do and help me keep my projects.

Note: this project need install MySQL server (with port 3306) in a local machine.
